## Workshop Description

This mod is my preferred setup for a new game of Twilight Imperium 4. It is built upon the hard work of many people in the community and designed to streamline the playing of TI4. In particular, big thanks to the following:
* Raptor1210 for the original TI4 mod and everyone who has contributed to it
* Cruix for the Map Tool
* the_Mantis for the "TI4 Graveyard". I also take a huge amount of inspiration from their other tools
* Cleril for their "Layout Overhaul" mod that inspired this (see 'History' below)
* CHRY for the wonderful "Customizable Buttons"

FEATURES
* One single button each for unpacking factions, returning strategies, and cleaning up tokens at the end of the round.
* Tech "research pads" to organize techs and clarify to all players who has researched what techs
* Hand areas are further back from the board (thanks Cleril!), allowing players to keep planet cards on the table railing and reserve the hex table for tiles and units.
* Warnings when you drop an unexpected component in a container it doesn't belong in. No more frantic hunting for that misplaced unit.

HISTORY & EXPLANATION FOR MAKING YET ANOTHER TI4 SETUP MOD
Originally this mod began as an attempt to port the_Mantis' unpack buttons into Cleril's TI4 setup mod. Once I looked at the code, I realized the_Mantis' scripts frequently have to account for size inconsistencies, typos in tokens and cards, and other problems caused by minor imperfections in the table setup. Porting the buttons to a new mod would be more work than just publishing a mod that removes these imperfections to begin with.

FEATURES FOR SCRIPTERS
* Consistent faction names and unit sizes
* Each item is placed precisely relative to the player drawer. No guesswork or fudge factors in unit placement.
