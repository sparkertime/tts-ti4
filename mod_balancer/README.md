# TI4 Map Playground w/ AutoBalancer

## Workshop ID
1636304723

## Workshop Description

This is a mod for making balanced Twilight Imperium 4 maps. To use, just drop tiles from the left side of the map to the right. As you build the map, balance information appears above each home system so that you can ensure your map has the perfect balance.

When you're all finished, the TI4 Map Tool by Cruix is included so you can import your map into a proper game.

NOTE: this calculation is pretty naive. It does not take anomalies or wormholes into consideration nor does it account for bizarre maps that wind or disconnect.

KNOWN BUGS
* If all home systems are more than 2 tiles away, the calculations are often wrong
